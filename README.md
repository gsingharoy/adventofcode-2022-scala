# Advent of code 2022 : Scala

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/gsingharoy/adventofcode-2022-scala.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/gsingharoy/adventofcode-2022-scala)

Code samples for problems from [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) written in scala. In this repository you will find one kind of implementations of the parts of the solutions for the 50 problems (25 x 2) available from the advent of code 2022 challenge. Most of the solutions are written with more functional practices from scala, which means no mutations and for loops are avoided. 

## How to find the solutions 

Navigate to the directory `src/main/scala/day*` to find all the necessary code for the particular day. In each of the packages there is an object class `Solution` which becomes the starting point of the solutions. eg, for the problem `Day7` you can see the start of the solution in `src/main/scala/day7/Solution`. 
There are unit cases for most of the code, and there is complete coverage for the inputs received from the website. Please note that inputs vary for each individuals, so there won't be a lot of benefit in copying results as they are :).
